# Challenge 2021

## Prediction part

Prediction of the number of bicycle passing between 00:01 AM and 09:00 AM on Friday, April 2nd.

Data : `data_bike.csv` (in Prediction file) load from https://compteurs.velocite-montpellier.fr/communautaire/albert 
 
## Visualization part

To visualize the bike traffic in Montpellier, we created a widget (graph of the traffic in 2020 for each counter) and a gif (map of Montpellier with all counter current 2020).

Data load from : https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs/resource/1a6d90b6-6ba7-4ed9-a092

Widget link : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Stephaniujka/Bike_Challenge_2021.git/master?filepath=Visualization%2Fwidget.ipynb)


The gif exceed 100 Mb. You can find it compressed in Visualization file (`bike_traffic_animated.zip`) and download the file directly from Github platform, or you can download it by clicking here :

The files `Montpellier_map_al` and `Montpellier images` from the code to create the gif are too heavy, and there are too many images in each file. So there are not present in this repository.
